Music Scheduling: radyolist‘s music scheduling module enables broadcasters to create and manage their playlists efficiently. With an intuitive interface and drag-and-drop functionality, broadcasters can easily arrange tracks according to their desired schedule. The system allows for precise control over track start and end times, transitions, and crossfades. Moreover, metadata such as artist, album, and genre can be associated with each track, facilitating comprehensive organization and searchability


Playout and Clock Management: radyolist‘s playout module, known as Studio, is responsible for handling the playback of audio content. It supports a wide range of audio formats, ensuring compatibility with various content sources. Studio enables broadcasters to define clock structures, ensuring accurate and automated playout based on predefined schedules. Clock management features enable the assignment of specific categories, genres, or types of content to different times of the day, enhancing the overall programming strategy.

Categories and Dayparting: radyolist allows broadcasters to categorize their audio content based on genres, moods, themes, or any other relevant criteria. This categorization facilitates targeted scheduling, ensuring that appropriate tracks are played at specific times. Dayparting, a feature commonly used in radio programming, allows broadcasters to allocate specific categories or content types to different times of the day, optimizing the programming for different listener segments and preferences.

Assignments and Rotation: radyolist‘s assignment feature enables broadcasters to define rules for track rotation. This ensures that tracks from different categories or artists are played in a balanced and fair manner, avoiding excessive repetition or neglect. Assignments can be customized based on specific criteria, such as the time of day, day of the week, or target audience, ensuring a varied and engaging listening experience.

Linux Compatibility and Technology Stack: radyolist is built to run on Linux systems, leveraging the stability, security, and flexibility offered by this open-source operating system. It utilizes the Apache web server for hosting the application, ensuring reliable and efficient performance. The project incorporates PHP for server-side scripting, React for building interactive user interfaces, and various JavaScript libraries to enhance functionality and user experience. Additionally, FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework, is integrated into radyolist to handle audio encoding, decoding, and streaming.

Interactive Management with Director: radyolist‘s management module, Director, provides broadcasters with an interactive interface to control and monitor the entire radio automation process. Director allows users to access and manage the system from any web browser, providing flexibility and remote access. From Director, broadcasters can schedule playlists, configure clock structures, create and assign categories, and generate reports to analyze audience engagement and performance.

Easy Editing and Placement of Ads and Promotions with Spotlist: radyolist‘s Spotlist module simplifies the process of editing and placing advertisements and promotions within the playlist. With Spotlist, broadcasters can easily import pre-recorded ads, assign specific time slots for airing, and ensure seamless transitions between content and commercials. This module streamlines the ad management process, allowing broadcasters to monetize their programming effectively.
